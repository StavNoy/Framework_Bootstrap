The goal of this project is to reproduce some of the features present in the Bootstrap framework.
You will need to reproduce all those described in this topic.
They do not have to have the same names as
in Boostrap, but their operation must be similar.
An unfinished feature will not be counted.
Do not go to another stage until you have finished all those before it, otherwise it will not count either.


!!!
	You will need to use Sass for the CSS part and jQuery for the JavaScript part.
	Any other technology is outlawed.
	The use of git is mandatory for this project and will be verified in defense.
	Make branches and use explicit commit messages.




1.
	We will start by making a grid, similar to that of Bootstrap.
	This will allow us to make responsive sites very easily.
	• .container and .container-fluid classes in which your grid will be located.
	• .row classes for each row of the grid.
	• Classes .col - * - * to fill each .row. These are the blocks you will modify according to the resolution.
